This repository is dedicated for learning linear regression on Boston housing data set using R


Let's see the data first. 
Housing Values in Suburbs of Boston

### Description

The Boston data frame has 506 rows and 14 columns.

This data frame contains the following columns:

`crim`
per capita crime rate by town.

`zn`
proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

Here one can see the columns and the values they contains.
`Tip For beginners`  run the script from top to bottom line by line so that you can see the progress ans the output of every line of the code. 



Here is what we get after changing the data-set into data frame

Now we will call fir function to see the error and statistics

Here we have got mean squared: 15.8 and other fir functions have recieved less error of course due to parameters.
